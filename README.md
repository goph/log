**Logging toolkit for libraries and applications based on [go-kit/kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit).**

This package is an extension of [go-kit/kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) providing additional tools and integration.


## Standard interface

This package originally tried to find an optimal standard interface for logging.
After some experiments I realized it's not an easy thing. There was even a [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1shW9DZJXOeGbG9Mr9Us9MiaPqmlcVatD_D8lrOXRNMU) to the standard library, which got rejected and became go-kit's logger implementation.
